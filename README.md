# Personnel Expenditure Analysis Tool

This tool is designed to help parliamentarians analyze government personnel spending, which accounts for roughly 49 per cent of the federal governmentâ€™s operating costs.

Parliamentarians have access to a wealth of data on personnel spending through sources like the Estimates, Public Accounts, and InfoBase. However, these sources do not easily address key questions such as:

- Is spending growth mainly due to higher staff numbers or higher spending per person?
- Are pay increases driven by salaries and wages, or by other forms of compensation?
- Which organizations contribute most to the growth in staffing?
- Which organizations contribute most to the growth in per-person spending?

To assist parliamentarians in scrutinizing this data, PBO has developed an interactive tool that allows users to compare trends across time for overall government spending or for a single department by:

- Viewing historic spending trends for operating and personnel spending;
- Analyzing the various types of compensation within the government's personnel spending;
- Examining historic employment trends for full-time equivalents (FTEs);
- Benchmarking departments or selecting specific ones for comparison.

The data can be displayed in aggregate or on a per-FTE basis.

All data in this tool is on a cash basis, sourced from publicly available information and reconciled to the Public Accounts of Canada and Departmental Results Reports. Some details are based on non-confidential data from the Receiver General for Canada. PBO takes full responsibility for the data in this tool, including any errors or omissions (see Notes for further details on data sources).
