## General notes

To create this tool and the database underlying it, the PBO collected data for 68 large and medium sized departments from 2006-07 to 2018-19. In 2018-19, this represented 99.9 percent of FTEs employed by the federal public service and 93 percent of overall personnel spending. 

For the purpose of this tool and its' accompanying report: 
1.	Federal employees include all Canadian Forces and RCMP employees but exclude employees of non-agent Crown corporations.
2.	Operating and personnel expenditures exclude costs associated with future expenses, accrual and other adjustments, consolidated Crown corporations and other entities, and consolidated specified purpose accounts. 
3. Personnel expenditures for individual departments in this tool will differ from those published in the Public Accounts. This is due to the redistribution of centralized spending under the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (see definition below and the report[link] for additional information). Personnel expenditures for the government as a whole will match the results published in the Public Accounts. 

## Grouping by similarity

To help users make relevant comparisons across departments, the PBO has developed a simple similarity score. To create the similarity score the Euclidian distance between each possible pairings of departments was calculated based on the number of FTEs, total expenditures, transfers-to-operating ratio, and its’ capital-to-operating ratio. Each factor was given equal weighting. When selecting a department on the [Compare, Similarity](/#/en/compare-similarity--comparer-similarites) page the 4 departments with the combined greatest similarity (least distance) to the selected department are also displayed. 

## Notes related to the treatment of specific departments

Due to differences in reporting between disaggregated and aggregated personnel expenditures some departments have been combined:

1. **Public Safety Canada:** includes the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee for all surveyed years. 
2. **Veterans Affairs Canada:** includes the Veterans Review and Appeal Board for all surveyed years. 
3. **Department of Women and Gender Equity (DWGE):**  the department was created by [Bill C-86](https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10127729) in December 2018, replacing the Office of the Coordinator, Status of Women (previously under the Department of Heritage Canada). For continuity, DWGE includes FTEs and expenditures that are listed under Status of Women in the 2019 Public Accounts. For all prior years, Status of Women is referred to as Women and Gender Equity in the tool. 
4. **Department of Justice:** includes the Public Prosecution Service of Canada from 2006-07 to 2007-08, as the office operated as a Special Agency under the Department of Justice for those years.
5. **Environment and Climate Change Canada:** includes the Impact Assessment Agency for all years surveyed, as the office operates as a Special Operating Agency under Environment and Climate Change Canada. 
6. **Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency:** The department was created in 2009 as a Special Operating Agency under Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. In 2011-12, the agency began to operate on its own. As such, data on the department is displayed only from 2011-12 onward.
7. **Employment and Social Development Canada:** On February 2006, the department of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada and Social Development Canada were consolidated into the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (currently known as Employment and Social Development Canada). In the 2007 Public Accounts and in IR0074 both departments are still listed separately. For consistency across all years, the departments were combined in 2006-07.

## Glossary

The PBO uses the following definitions in this online tool and its’ accompanying report: 

**Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** – is a unit of measure that indicates the workload of an employed person. FTEs are calculated as a ratio of assigned hours of work throughout the year to scheduled hours of work, as set out in collective agreements. For term and seasonal employees, the FTE calculation is also adjusted for the proportion of paid weeks in a year (Source: Departmental Result Reports, InfoBase, and an informal request to TBS).

**Operating spending** – Includes personnel, quasi-personnel, professional and special services and other subsidies and payments (as defined below). This excludes spending associated with consolidated Crown corporations, accrual and adjustments, and consolidated specified purpose accounts (Source: Public Accounts, Standard Objects 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and 12).

**Personnel spending** – Includes all current cash expenditures related to personnel, including salaries and wages, and the government’s annual cash contributions to various employee pension and benefit plans (Source: Public Accounts, Standard Object 1). 

The components of personnel spending are (Source: IR0074): 
1. **Salaries and wages** – Include payments related to the salaries of civilian, military, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) personnel as defined by their collective agreements (includes continuing, part-time, seasonal, casual and student employment), and other salaries and wages.
2. **Overtime and Bonus** – Includes civilian premium, holiday, overtime pay, and other allowances and benefits; the bilingual bonus; and Royal Canadian Mounted Police members overtime pay and pay in lieu of leave.
3. **Pension** – includes federal contributions to its’ defined benefit pension plans (public service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Canadian Armed Forces). As well as federal contributions for the Public Service Death Benefit Account, the Canadian Forces Supplementary Death Benefit, the Retirement Compensation Arrangements Account, the Members of Parliament Retirement Allowance Account, the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans, and other pension payments and supplementary personnel costs including Judges Act.
4. **Employment Insurance** - Employer contribution to Employment Insurance.
5. **Other payments related to health and benefits:** 
    * **Centralized Spending** – As the employer of the public service, the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) incurs costs related to employees in other departments. Under the Government’s accounting standards these costs are the responsibility of the TBS, they reflect total compensation total compensation for work completed in each employee’s respective employing department. As such, the PBO has chosen to reallocate these costs across all departments (for which Treasury Board is the employer) weighted by the departments’ total spending on personnel. These costs include:

        1. Account deficiencies related to the Public Service Pension Plan;
        2. Employer contribution to Retirement Compensation Arrangements Account;
        3. Employer contribution to hospital and medical plans;
        4. Employer contribution for disability insurance, and;
        5. Other employer contributions. 
    
    The portion of these costs that is not incurred by TBS is included in other payments, except for Employer contribution to Retirement Compensation Arrangements Account which is under pension payments.

    Central spending also includes costs related to account deficiencies of the RCMP Pension Plan (under RCMP) and the Canadian Forces Pension Plan (under the Department of National Defence). Public Sector Pension Plan costs are allocated to departments whose staff contribute to and are eligible for the Public Service Pension Plan. Other pension plan costs are allocated to the relevant departments (for example, actuarial deficiencies for the RCMP Pension Plan are allocated only to the RCMP).
      
    * **Other payments** – includes severance pay and termination benefits, retroactive payments for current and prior fiscal years, pay equities and various allowances reallocation of capital expenditures, payments related to executive interchange and other exchange programs, provincial workers’ compensation boards payments and recoveries, compensation for additional or specific duties performed and supplementary employee benefits and other supplementary personnel costs. 
    
    Other payments also include the costs listed under centralized spending that are not incurred by TBS (see note above).

**Quasi-personnel** – Includes costs related to transportation and communications, information, rentals, repair and maintenance, and utilities, materials and supplies (Source: Public Accounts, Standard Objects 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7).

**Professional and Special Services** – Includes all expenditures related to professional and special services, including services performed by individuals or organizations and payments for hospital treatment, care of veterans and welfare services (Source: Public Accounts, Standard Object 4).

**Other Subsidies and Payments** – Includes all expenditures in the forms of subsidies and payments not elsewhere specified by another Standard Object, including payments to certain non–budgetary accounts, as well as the write-offs of various types of losses, the annual adjustment of reserves for financial claims and some other miscellaneous items referred to as “Sundries” (Source: Public Accounts, Standard Object 12).
